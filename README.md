# Portfolio-React

## Description

This is a single-page application portfolio built using React, designed to showcase the work samples of a web developer. The portfolio includes sections such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, allowing potential employers or collaborators to assess the developer's skills and experience.

## Website

The deployed portfolio can be accessed [here](https://devan-ash-portfolio.netlify.app).

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When loading the portfolio, a header, a section for content, and a footer are presented.
- The header displays the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
- Navigation titles include About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with the current section highlighted.
- Clicking on a navigation title changes the browser URL and presents the corresponding section below the navigation.
- The About Me section includes a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio.
- The Portfolio section displays titled images of the developer’s applications with links to deployed applications and corresponding GitHub repositories.
- The Contact section includes a contact form with fields for name, email address, and message, with validation for required fields and email format.
- The Resume section includes a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
